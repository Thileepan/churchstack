						<p>As we provide a full featured trial of our product to all our customers with no limitaions, we encourage you to try before you buy.</p>

						<p>In fact, we insist that you try <?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?> first and experience its cool features, terrific performance, cheapest pricing first-hand - before making a purchase!</p>

						<p>If for some reason, you ask for a refund, we'll give it to you. There are a couple of points you need to know in this context, though:</p>

						<p><b>Monthly Subscription</b></p>
						<p>If you are paying/charged monthly for using the product (<?php echo PRODUCT_NAME; ?>), you can request for a refund anytime. However, the refund amount you get will be prorated. i.e., if you have used the product for 15 days of the current billing cycle, the refund amount that you will get is almost half of what you been charged for the current month. Hope you get what we mean!</p>

						<p><b>Yearly Subscription</b></p>
						<p>For yearly subscriptions which gives you a huge discount when compared to monthly subscription, you need to ask for a refund within 60 days of buying the product. In other words, once you have become a paid customer who has been using the product by purchasing a plan, if your current subscription is "yearly", you need to ask for a refund within 60 days <u>from the date you became a paid customer</u>.</p>

						<p><b>Deductions on the refund amount</b></p>
						<p>Please note that our payment gateway may not refund us the transaction commissions and foreign currency markup fee on certain circumstances. When you make a payment online for buying a product/plan from us, they (separately) charge us a percentage of your transacted amount. Hence, any refunds you may receive will be 'net of transaction commissions' that may have been charged by our payment gateway - simply because those costs have already been (separately) charged to us.</p>
						<p>Therefore, from the refund amount, we reserve the right to deduct the payment gateway charges, foreign currency markup fee and other charges on which we do not have control</p>

						<p>Of course, standard disclaimers apply, and we reserve the right to change our refund policy as we deem appropriate. Legalese aside, we're pretty straight forward and very easy to work with! Find out for yourself.</p>
